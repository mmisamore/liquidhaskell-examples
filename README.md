# My Worked Answers to the LiquidHaskell tutorial

See [The Tutorial](http://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-tutorial/).

This repo is also an example of a simple setup for running LiquidHaskell with The Haskell Tool Stack.
I tend to match the nightly that the main LiquidHaskell branch is using.
